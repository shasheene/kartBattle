kartBattle
==========

OpenGL Mario Kart 64-style battle mode

Note (November 2014): This project was completed for a 2013 Computer Graphics group assignment looking at lighting and various other details in OpenGL. Given the time available, building a highly-polished game play wasn't the goal of that particular assignment (but I plan to revisit kartBattle game play eventually, perhaps in Unity)
